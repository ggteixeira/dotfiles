# Unordered list indentation
# I disable this because for some documents I use 4 space indenting, like

# Hard tabs
# https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/md010.md
# This rule is triggered by any lines that contain hard tab characters instead
# of using spaces for indentation. To fix this, replace any hard tab characters
# with spaces instead

# Line length
# I disabled this because autoformatting takes care of the line length for me,

# at the end, it will trigger it, and haven't looked into how to fix that
